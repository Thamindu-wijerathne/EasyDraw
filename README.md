# EasyDraw

Your code is a great implementation for a gesture-based drawing application with Streamlit integration. Here's a breakdown of its functionality and key elements:

How the Code Works
Dependencies:
The code uses libraries like cv2 (OpenCV), numpy, mediapipe, and streamlit to process webcam input and manage gesture-based drawing functionality.

Gesture-Based Interaction:

Index Finger Up: Starts drawing after being held for 2 seconds.
Three Fingers Up: Saves the drawing as drawing_output.png after being held for 3 seconds.
All Fingers Down: Clears the canvas.
Streamlit UI:

Live webcam feed and drawing updates are displayed using st.image.
A "Save Drawing" button lets users manually save their drawing.
File Saving and AI Processing:

Images are saved to disk and passed to an API_CONNECTOR for AI-based enhancements.
Running the Code
To execute this program:

Ensure Dependencies are Installed:
Install the required libraries using the commands:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit opencv-python mediapipe numpy  
pip install -q -U google-generativeai python-dotenv openai  
pip install --upgrade Pillow  
pip install -U git+https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-python@imagen  
Organize Project Structure:

Place this script in a file named app.py.
Ensure auxiliary files like gestures.py, API_CONNECTOR.py, and UI.py exist and are properly implemented.
Run the Application:
Use the command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run main.py  
Interacting with the Application:

The webcam feed will be displayed, along with options for drawing and saving images.
Follow gesture instructions to draw, save, or clear the canvas.
Generated Output:

Drawings are saved as drawing_output.png.
Enhanced images from the API_CONNECTOR are displayed dynamically.
